        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          At FunForAll, we believe that travel is more than just ticking off
          destinations on a map. It’s about immersing yourself in diverse
          cultures, savoring local cuisines, and discovering hidden gems. Our
          journey began with a simple idea: to make travel accessible,
          enjoyable, and stress-free. From organizing thrilling treks in the
          Himalayas to planning serene beach getaways, we’ve grown into a
          community of passionate travelers who share a common love for
          exploration.
